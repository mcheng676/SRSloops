***PROGRAM 5***
Write a program that prompts the user to enter an integer. The program will then print an isosceles triangle made of asterisks (*) with that leg length. 

(Hints- Leg length 4 requires a total of 4 lines of asterisks:
The 1st line will require 3 spaces followed by 1 asterisk.
The 2nd line will require 2 spaces followed by 3 asterisks.
The 3rd line will require 1 space followed by 5 asterisks.
The 4th line will require no spaces followed by 7 asterisks.

Leg length 5 requires a total of 5 lines of asterisks:
The 1st line will require 4 spaces followed by 1 asterisk.
The 2nd line will require 3 spaces followed by 3 asterisks.
The 3rd line will require 2 spaces followed by 5 asterisks.
The 4th line will require 1 space followed by 7 asterisks.
The 5th line will require no spaces followed by 9 asterisks.

You may find string replication (' ' * 3 ,  '*' * 5) particularly helpful here.)

Examples of what should appear on the console when the program runs:

Enter the leg length: 4

   *
  ***
 *****
*******
   
Enter the leg length: 5

    *
   ***
  *****
 *******
*********
